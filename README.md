# git-pagsa
A repository for the PAGSA git workshop.

I got a VERY important e-mail today. A Nigerian prince has been kidnapped and lost access to the royal treasury. The only thing he has access to is this git repository! We have to learn how to use git and quickly get all of our social insurance numbers, dates of birth, and credit card information uploaded here so that he can free himself and reward us all handsomely.

In this workshop, we'll discuss a number of git-related functions, including:

 * ssh keys
 * the pro git book
 * cloning, pushing, pulling
 * fetching and merging
 * commits
 * rebasing and resetting

and more!
